# Hybrid Architecture: Integrating a Relational Database with File Storage

Integrating a relational database with file-based storage creates a powerful hybrid architecture for your Minecraft IDE project. Let's explore how this could work at an architectural level.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Database Layer

**Database Selection**
- **SQLite**: Embedded database requiring no server, stored as a single file in the project directory
- **Advantages**: Zero configuration, portable across platforms, no separate installation
- **Use case**: Ideal for a desktop IDE where each project is self-contained

**Schema Design (High-Level)**

```
Projects
├── id (primary key)
├── name
├── description
├── base_version
├── supported_versions (JSON array)
└── settings (JSON)

Resources
├── id (primary key)
├── project_id (foreign key)
├── namespace
├── type (function, model, etc.)
├── path
├── canonical_path (fully qualified resource path)
└── metadata (JSON for extensibility)

VersionOverrides
├── id (primary key)
├── resource_id (foreign key)
├── version_id
├── has_custom_content (boolean)
└── metadata (JSON)

Dependencies
├── source_id (foreign key)
├── target_id (foreign key)
└── dependency_type

Tags
├── resource_id (foreign key)
├── tag_name
```

### 2. File System Layer

**Directory Structure**

```
project/
├── .mide/ (hidden project directory)
│   ├── project.db (SQLite database)
│   ├── metadata/ (additional metadata files)
│   └── cache/ (compiled output, previews)
├── content/ (normalized content storage)
│   ├── resources/
│   │   ├── [namespace]/
│   │   │   ├── [type]/
│   │   │   │   ├── [resource-path].base (base version content)
│   │   │   │   └── [resource-path].[version] (version-specific content)
└── export/ (optional directory for Minecraft-format exports)
```

### 3. Coordination Layer

This critical component synchronizes between database and file system:

1. **Resource Manager**
    - Maps between logical resources (database entries) and physical files
    - Ensures consistency between database records and file existence

2. **Change Tracking**
    - Monitors file system changes
    - Updates database when files change
    - Handles conflicts

3. **Transaction Coordinator**
    - Ensures operations spanning database and files maintain consistency
    - Implements rollback capability for failed operations

## Integration Architecture

### 1. Database Integration

**Connection Management**
- Connection pool for efficient database access
- Single connection per project
- Connection lifecycle tied to project open/close events

**Data Access Layer**
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Type-safe query builders
- Prepared statements for security and performance

**Schema Migration**
- Version-controlled schema evolution
- Automatic upgrades when opening projects created with older versions
- Backward compatibility strategy

### 2. Synchronization Mechanisms

**File System Watching**
- Watch for external changes to content files
- Reconcile with database state
- Support collaborative workflows

**Database Change Notification**
- Propagate database changes to UI
- Enable reactive updates to views

**Locking Strategy**
- Optimistic locking for most operations
- Pessimistic locking for critical sections
- Conflict resolution UI for concurrent edits

### 3. Transaction Handling

**Composite Transactions**
- Begin transaction in database
- Perform file operations
- Commit or rollback database transaction
- Clean up file system on failure

**Example Flow:**
1. Start database transaction
2. Update resource metadata in database
3. Write new content to temporary file
4. On success: commit transaction and move temp file to final location
5. On failure: rollback transaction and delete temp file

## Key Implementation Considerations

### 1. Database Access Library

For Rust, you have several good options:
- `rusqlite`: Low-level SQLite bindings
- `diesel`: ORM with compile-time checked queries
- `sqlx`: Async SQL with compile-time query checking

Architectural considerations:
- Abstract the database implementation behind interfaces
- Use a repository pattern to separate business logic from data access
- Consider async/sync requirements of your application

### 2. File System Abstraction

Create a virtual file system layer:
- Maps between logical paths and physical paths
- Handles version resolution
- Manages file operations within transactions

### 3. Caching Strategy

Implement a multi-level cache:
- In-memory cache for active resources
- Disk cache for compiled outputs
- Cache invalidation tied to change tracking

### 4. Error Handling and Recovery

Design for resilience:
- Journaling for critical operations
- Recovery procedures for interrupted operations
- Automatic backup strategy

## Architecture Benefits

This hybrid approach offers several advantages:

1. **Best of Both Worlds**
    - Database for fast queries, relationships, and metadata
    - Files for content that's easy to inspect, diff, and edit

2. **Separation of Concerns**
    - Content storage separate from metadata
    - Clear boundaries between subsystems

3. **Performance Optimization**
    - Database indices for fast lookups
    - File system for efficient content storage and streaming

4. **Flexibility**
    - Schema evolution without affecting content
    - Content format changes without affecting relationships

5. **Transparency**
    - Content remains accessible even without the application
    - Database can be rebuilt from content if necessary

## Practical Implementation Path

To integrate this architecture into your project:

1. **Start with Schema Design**
    - Finalize your database schema
    - Map out relationships between entities

2. **Create Database Abstraction Layer**
    - Implement repositories for each entity type
    - Define clear interfaces for database operations

3. **Develop Coordination Layer**
    - Implement file system abstractions
    - Build transaction coordination

4. **Add Change Tracking**
    - Implement watchers for external changes
    - Build diffing and merge capabilities

5. **Build Export/Import Pipeline**
    - Create transformations between your format and Minecraft format
    - Implement validation for exported packs
