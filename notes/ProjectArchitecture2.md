# High-Level Architecture for a Functional Repository Pattern

Here's an architectural outline for implementing a functional approach to the repository pattern, focusing on structure and organization rather than specific code implementations.

## Overall Architecture

```
src/
├── domain/          # Pure domain models and business logic
├── repositories/    # Data access functions grouped by domain entity
├── services/        # Business logic and orchestration functions
├── db/              # Database connection and configuration
└── api/             # API endpoints that consume services
```

## Components Overview

### 1. Domain Models

- Pure data structures representing your domain concepts
- No infrastructure dependencies
- May contain domain-specific validation logic
- Focused on representing business concepts accurately

### 2. Repository Functions

- Organized in modules by domain entity (project_repository, user_repository, etc.)
- Each module contains related functions for data access
- Functions accept database connection as first parameter
- Clear transformation between database models and domain models
- Handle all data access concerns

### 3. Service Functions

- Implement business use cases
- Orchestrate calls to multiple repository functions
- Handle transactional boundaries
- Contain business logic that spans multiple entities
- May perform authorization checks

### 4. Database Module

- Manages connection pooling
- Provides transaction wrappers
- Handles database initialization and migrations
- Offers helper functions for common database operations

### 5. API Layer

- Routes/endpoints that map to service functions
- Validates input and formats output
- Handles HTTP-specific concerns
- Manages authentication
- Translates service errors to appropriate HTTP responses

## Key Patterns

### Function Composition

Services compose repository functions together to implement complete use cases:

```
get_project_details = combine(
    find_project_by_id,
    fetch_project_resources,
    fetch_project_contributors
)
```

### Function Specialization

Generic functions with specialized versions for specific use cases:

```
find_projects → find_projects_by_type → find_minecraft_projects
```

### Database Connection Management

Connection pool accessible to all functions, with transactions when needed:

```
with_transaction(db_pool, |conn| async {
    // Multiple repository operations using the same transaction
})
```

### Error Handling

Consistent error handling through Results with domain-specific errors:

```
Result<T, AppError>  // AppError contains various error categories
```

## Data Flow Examples

### Creating a Project

1. API layer validates request and extracts parameters
2. Calls project_service::create_project with DB connection and parameters
3. Service constructs domain Project entity
4. Service calls project_repository::save with connection and project
5. Repository handles DB-specific concerns (SQL, ORM, etc.)
6. Result flows back up through the layers

### Querying Projects

1. API receives query parameters
2. Passes to appropriate service function with DB connection
3. Service determines correct repository functions to call
4. Repository functions translate query to database operations
5. Repository maps database results to domain entities
6. Service performs any additional enrichment/filtering
7. Returns results to API layer for response formatting

## Key Architectural Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
    - Domain models know nothing about persistence
    - Repository functions focus purely on data access
    - Services handle business processes and orchestration

2. **Testability**
    - Functions with explicit dependencies are easy to test
    - Mocking database connections for testing is straightforward
    - Pure domain logic can be tested without database

3. **Flexibility**
    - Switch database implementations by changing repository internals
    - Repository functions can be reused across different services
    - Services can be composed to create higher-level services

4. **Simplicity**
    - Fewer abstraction layers than OOP approaches
    - No complex inheritance or trait hierarchies
    - Function signatures clearly show dependencies and data flow

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Configuration**: How to manage database connection parameters
- **Error Propagation**: Consistent error handling across function boundaries
- **Transactions**: Managing transactions across multiple repository calls
- **Authentication**: How to pass and verify authentication throughout the system
- **Connection Management**: Efficiently reusing database connections

# Functional Architecture Analysis for Minecraft IDE Project

Let's analyze how the functional repository pattern would fit within the context of your Minecraft datapack/resourcepack IDE.

## Key Domain Entities in a Minecraft IDE

1. **Projects** - Representing either datapacks or resourcepacks
2. **Files/Resources** - Managing Minecraft-specific files (JSON, mcfunction, etc.)
3. **MinecraftVersions** - Different game versions with their schemas and validations
4. **UserSettings** - IDE preferences and configurations
5. **Workspaces** - Collections of related projects

## Architecture Analysis

### Domain Models

For your Minecraft IDE, domain models would represent core concepts:

- **Project** - Contains metadata about datapacks/resourcepacks
    - Properties: name, path, type (datapack/resourcepack), minecraft version, etc.
    - May contain validation rules for project structure

- **MinecraftFile** - Represents files within projects
    - Properties: path, content, type (mcfunction, json, png, etc.)
    - Minecraft-specific validation and parsing logic

- **Workspace** - Groups of related projects
    - Properties: name, included projects, active project

- **MinecraftVersion** - Game version data
    - Properties: version string, supported features, schema rules

### Repository Functions

Repository functions would handle persistence of these domain entities:

**project_repository**
- Functions to save/load projects from disk or database
- Query projects by type, version, or other attributes
- Manage project metadata persistence
- Handle project import/export operations

**file_repository**
- Functions to read/write Minecraft files
- Track file changes
- Handle file system operations specific to datapacks/resourcepacks
- Manage file templates

**workspace_repository**
- Functions to persist workspace configurations
- Load/save collections of related projects
- Track workspace state (open files, layout)

**minecraft_version_repository**
- Functions to fetch version information
- Load schemas for specific versions
- Retrieve version-specific validation rules

### Service Functions

Services would implement IDE features using repository functions:

**project_service**
- Project creation with appropriate templates based on type
- Project validation against Minecraft standards
- Project building and packaging
- Project importing from existing datapacks/resourcepacks

**editor_service**
- File editing with syntax highlighting
- Code completion based on Minecraft version
- Validation against schemas
- Handling file relationships (e.g., references between files)

**preview_service**
- Generate previews for Minecraft elements
- Simulate command execution
- Visualize structures, items, etc.

**export_service**
- Package projects into distributable formats
- Generate documentation
- Validate projects before export

**minecraft_service**
- Fetch version information from Mojang API
- Parse Minecraft assets for reference data
- Extract validation schemas from game data

### Database/Storage Layer

For your IDE, "database" might include multiple storage mechanisms:

1. **Local file system** - For project files and resources
2. **SQLite/embedded database** - For metadata, caching, and indexing
3. **Configuration files** - For user settings and preferences
4. **In-memory storage** - For temporary data during editing

### API Layer

In a desktop IDE context, your "API" is the UI interaction layer:

1. **UI Components** - Interface with service functions
2. **Commands** - Represent user actions that call services
3. **Events** - System for components to react to changes in data
4. **State Management** - Tracking application state across the UI

## Benefits for Minecraft IDE

1. **Separation of Minecraft Logic from Tool Logic**
    - Domain models represent Minecraft concepts purely
    - Repository functions handle specific file formats and structures
    - Services implement IDE features on top of these abstractions

2. **Version Compatibility Management**
    - Version-specific repositories can handle differences between Minecraft versions
    - Services can apply appropriate validations based on project version
    - Clear separation makes supporting multiple versions easier

3. **Project Type Flexibility**
    - Handle differences between datapacks and resourcepacks through specialized functions
    - Share common functionality while allowing for type-specific features
    - Easy to extend for new Minecraft content types (behavior packs, add-ons)

4. **Testability**
    - Test Minecraft-specific logic independently from UI
    - Mock filesystem operations for testing without creating actual files
    - Write tests for validation rules against sample data

5. **Performance Benefits**
    - Functional approach enables easy parallelization of operations
    - Clear data flow makes optimization opportunities visible
    - Caching can be implemented at precise points in the function chain

## Implementation Considerations

1. **File Watching and Change Detection**
    - How repository functions handle external file changes
    - Maintaining consistency between in-memory and on-disk state

2. **Minecraft Schema Management**
    - How to store and apply validation rules for different versions
    - Balancing between strict validation and flexibility for creative use

3. **Real-time Validation**
    - When to trigger validation during editing
    - How to handle validation errors without disrupting workflow

4. **Project Templates**
    - Managing starter templates for different project types
    - Customizing templates based on user preferences

5. **Resource Handling**
    - Efficient handling of non-text resources (textures, models, sounds)
    - Preview generation for visual elements

## Example Data Flow: Creating a New Datapack

1. User requests to create a new datapack project
2. UI calls `project_service::create_datapack_project`
3. Service determines appropriate structure based on selected Minecraft version
4. Service calls `minecraft_version_repository::get_datapack_structure` for template
5. Service prepares project structure in memory
6. Service calls `project_repository::save_project` to persist metadata
7. Service calls `file_repository::create_files` to create initial files and directories
8. UI receives successful result and updates project explorer

This functional architecture provides a clean separation of concerns while efficiently handling the specific needs of a Minecraft development environment. The explicit data flow makes it easier to reason about operations and modify behavior as Minecraft itself evolves.
